description: Dallas McCord ""Mack"" Reynolds was an American science fiction writer.
  His pen names included Dallas Ross, Mark Mallory, Clark Collins, Dallas Rose, Guy
  McCord, Maxine Reynolds, Bob Belmont, and Todd Harding. His work is noteworthy for
  its focus on socioeconomic speculation, usually expressed in thought-provoking explorations
  of Utopian societies from a radical, sometime satiric, perspective. He was a considerably
  popular author from the 1950s to the 1970s, especially with readers of science fiction
  and fantasy magazines.
